https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.00916 (v v nice, and implemented in pennylane) â€“ we can get close to this with naive, almost brute force method

qiskit, but migrate to pennylane as soon as possible

interesting method: take a ResNet (Residual Network), amputate it, and stick the QNN in the end with the embeddings(?) from the ResNet

python version for the env: 

applications in RL:
- they have a PhD student using RL for optimising parameters in QNN methods (???)
