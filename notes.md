https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.00916 (v v nice, and implemented in pennylane) – we can get close to this with naive, almost brute force method

qiskit, but migrate to pennylane as soon as possible

interesting method: take a ResNet (Residual Network), amputate it, and stick the QNN in the end with the embeddings(?) from the ResNet

python version for the env: 3.9.6 (during the tutorial)

applications in RL:
- they have a PhD student using RL for optimising parameters in QNN methods (???) READ THEIR PAPER – https://inspirehep.net/files/2474d7eea346b01047a10568129fc2d0 (also the main results in a future paper not yet published publically)
- other publications by Patrick Selig (the phd student in the lab)
